## Introduction

This repository contains a collection of sample **Directed Acyclic Graphs (DAGs)** for **Apache Airflow**, showcasing different scenarios and use cases for practice. It aims to demonstrate various Airflow functionalities, including:

- Scheduling and triggering workflows
- Managing task dependencies
- Using various operators (PythonOperator, BashOperator, etc.)
- Working with Airflow plugins and custom scripts

## Prerequisites

Before running the Airflow DAGs, make sure you have the following prerequisites:

- **Python 3.7+**
- **Apache Airflow 2.0+**
- **Docker (optional but recommended for a containerized setup)**
- Basic knowledge of Airflow concepts and Python programming

## Installation

To get started with the project, follow these steps:

1. **Clone the repository:**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Muhammadibra40/airflow-dags-practice.git
   cd airflow-dags-practice
   ```

2. **Set up a virtual environment:**
   ```bash
   python3 -m venv venv
   source venv/bin/activate   # On Windows use `venv\Scripts\activate`
   ```

3. **Install dependencies:**
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

4. **Initialize Airflow database:**
   ```bash
   airflow db init
   ```

5. **Start the Airflow web server and scheduler:**
   ```bash
   airflow webserver -p 8080
   airflow scheduler
   ```

6. **Access the Airflow UI:**
   Open a browser and go to `http://localhost:8080` to see the Airflow dashboard.

## Repository Structure

The repository is organized as follows:

```
airflow-dags-practice/
│
├── dags/               # Contains the DAG files
│   ├── example_dag_1.py
│   ├── example_dag_2.py
│   └── ...
│
└── README.md           # Project documentation
```

## DAGs Overview

Here’s a brief description of the DAGs available in this repository:

1. **example_dag_1.py**: 
   - Demonstrates basic scheduling and task dependencies using `PythonOperator` and `BashOperator`.
   - Simulates a simple ETL workflow (Extract, Transform, Load).

2. **example_dag_2.py**:
   - Showcases the use of branching and conditional tasks.
   - Utilizes the `BranchPythonOperator` to decide the next step in the workflow based on dynamic conditions.

3. **example_dag_3.py**:
   - Implements advanced features such as task retries, SLAs, and triggering external DAGs.

## How to Run

1. **Place your DAG files** in the `dags/` folder.
2. **Start the Airflow web server and scheduler** (as shown in the Installation section).
3. **Enable the DAG** you want to run from the Airflow UI (`http://localhost:8080`).
4. **Trigger the DAG manually** from the Airflow UI or let it run based on its schedule.

## Useful Commands

- **List all active DAGs:**
  ```bash
  airflow dags list
  ```

- **Trigger a DAG manually:**
  ```bash
  airflow dags trigger <dag_id>
  ```

- **Pause or unpause a DAG:**
  ```bash
  airflow dags pause <dag_id>
  airflow dags unpause <dag_id>
  ```

- **Check the status of a DAG run:**
  ```bash
  airflow dags state <dag_id> <execution_date>
  ```
